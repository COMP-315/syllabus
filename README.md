#### Catalog Description:

> Parallel Algorithms provides an introduction to designing parallel algorithms and organizing parallel computing systems. We explore software in multiprocessor environments and investigate building and using a cluster. Then, we evaluate the performance of our distributed systems against cloud computing. Finally, we discuss broader impacts of data centers and high-performance computing.

## Workload

It is the expectation for all classes taught at Wheaton College that one hour of class time may expect two to three hours of preparation outside of class.  In addition to preparation time, programming assignments are designed to take a significant amount of time per week.  Start all assignments _early_. **No late work is accepted**.

## Academic Integrity

All work and submissions in this course must be entirely your own original content.  Assignments and examinations are to be done individually unless otherwise specified.  Laboratories are collaborative and should be done in pairs.  Resources (electronic and print) that contain documentation about programming languages are typically allowed, but those containing implementations of assignment components -- except the course texts -- are off limits.  At the discretion of the instructor, violations of academic integrity will result in penalties up to and including failing the course and reporting the violation to the College Hearing Board. If you have general questions/concerns or specific instances to discuss, do not hesitate to ask in class or privately.

## Accommodation

Wheaton is committed to ensuring equitable access to programs and services and to prohibit discrimination in the recruitment, admission, and education of students with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities requiring accommodations or information on accessibility should contact Abigail Cohen, Assisant Dean of Accessibility and Assistive Technology at the Filene Center for Academic Advising and Career Services.
